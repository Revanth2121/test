<h3>S. Venkata Rami Reddy</h3>
 <p>It is my pleasure to communicate through this Website of SVR Engineering College.
    I invite the students and people at large to visit this web-site regularly to have regular and updated information about the college. This will be of immense help particularly to the students seeking admission in this college. “Learning gives creativity,creativity leads to thinking, thinking provides Knowledge, Knowledge makes you great”. This is all a process, if we stop learning and thinking, then there is no creativity and knowledge in our life. Never lose the thirst for learning.
    I wish you all the best for your future endeavors.
